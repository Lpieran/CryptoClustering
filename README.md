# CryptoClustering

The main purpose of this code is to compare the clustering results obtained using K-Means on the original data with those obtained after applying PCA and then running K-Means. 

By using PCA, the data's dimensionality is reduced, which can help to simplify the clustering process and potentially improve the clustering performance. 

The visualizations allow you to compare how well the clusters align between the original data and the transformed PCA data. It helps to understand how PCA affects the clustering results and whether the dimensionality reduction preserves meaningful patterns in the data.

In summary, the code aims to compare K-Means clustering results on the original cryptocurrency market data with those obtained after applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. It visualizes and contrasts the clustering outcomes in the original feature space and the transformed PCA space to understand the impact of using fewer features on the clustering performance.
